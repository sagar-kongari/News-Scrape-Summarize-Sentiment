       "  'The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city state’s central bank, has proposed a framework for designing open, interoperable networks for digital assets, developed jointly with the Bank for International Settlements and other financial institutions. See related article: Hong Kong? Singapore? Tokyo? Seoul? Dubai? The race is on for the Web3 hub of Asia | Part 1 “While MAS strongly discourages and seeks to restrict speculation in cryptocurrencies, we see much potential for value creation and efficiency gains in the digital asset ecosystem. This is why we are actively collaborating with the industry to foster a responsible and innovative digital asset ecosystem,” Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director of Markets and Development, at MAS, said in a statement on Monday. MAS also announced an expansion of Project Guardian to test the potential of asset tokenization across more financial asset classes. The central bank has enlisted 11 financial institutions, including banking giants Citi, HSBC, DBS, Standard Chartered, which will lead industry pilots in asset and wealth management, foreign exchange, and fixed income. Citi, for instance, is testing the pricing and execution of digital asset trades on a distributed ledger, MAS said. Standard Chartered and Linklogis are working on an initial token offering platform to enable the issuance of asset-backed security tokens listed on the Singapore Exchange. SBI Digital Asset Holdings, UBS AG and DBS Bank are developing a pilot repurchasing agreement (repo) with natively issued digital bonds, MAS said. The initiative is aimed at increasing efficiency for cross-border distribution and settlement of capital market instruments on digital asset networks. Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) has also come onboard as the first overseas financial regulator to join Project Guardian, MAS said. JFSA and MAS will work on digital asset innovation for asset tokenization while safeguarding against risks to financial stability and integrity.',\n",

The completion of the tender offer through Friday is setting up grounds for expected delisting of Shinsei to give more flexibility in returning 349 billion yen ($2.43 billion) in public funds its predecessor bank received two decades ago in a government bailout. SBI Holdings said last month it would take SBI Shinsei Bank private and launch the tender offer with plans to pay 2,800 yen per Shinsei share for 154.2 billion yen in total.

The new bourse is the latest in a wave of carbon-credit trading platforms that have launched across Asia as demand from companies seeking to offset their emissions explodes.

       "  'Singapore-based QCP Capital and Japan-based SBI Alpha Trading on Thursday said they executed an over-the-counter (OTC) crypto options trade on a regulated platform without involving a clearing house, the first such transaction in the digital asset industry. The so-called uncleared trade negotiated directly between QCP and SBI Alpha used bitcoin (BTC) as collateral and was executed on Clear Markets, operators of a U.S. and U.K.-based regulated electronic marketplace, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. London-based Zodia Custody acted as a custodian for collateral while Corda Network, developed by R3, played a role in risk management. The trade used a multi-custodian collateral network to ensure the assets held in custody remain separate from the custodian\\'s assets. That way, the collateral remains safe if the custodian goes bankrupt. The trading parties collected the collateral at the start of the transaction and locked the same in an account at an independent custodian, which was controlled by all three parties to mitigate the counterparty risk stemming from the absence of a clearing house. All exchange-traded derivatives and most over-the-counter derivatives involve a clearing house that validates and finalizes the transaction, ensuring the parties to the trade honor their contractual obligations. QCP and SBI Alpha also introduced a feature allowing real-time bolstering of collateral by periodic payments through the blockchain while protecting the collateral from loss in case of counterparty bankruptcy. The unique risk management technique is consistent with International Swaps and Derivatives Association\\'s (ISDA) requirements for uncleared derivatives in the multi-trillion dollar fiat currency swap business. \"This method of managing counterparty credit exposure, derived from traditional financial markets practices, eliminates significant risks taken by counterparties of FTX and other crypto trading units that have collapsed,\" the press release said. \"This reduces the cost of moving the collateral and enables increased frequency of'],\n",
